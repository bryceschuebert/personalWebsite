The College of Engineering purchased two 3D scanners, [Artec Leo](https://www.artec3d.com/portable-3d-scanners/artec-leo) [& Spider](https://www.artec3d.com/portable-3d-scanners/artec-spider#overview), for creating complex 3D geometries. After learning the software with practice products, I scanned a whale skull for the College of Ecology.
