As soon as COVID locked down the country, the College of Engineering designated the fabrication team as essential workers, so we could start making face shields, swabs, and respirators for the the University of Georgia. With supply chains fractured, I had to source local materials while designing, testing, and manufacturing 1000s of comfortable & effective face shields.
