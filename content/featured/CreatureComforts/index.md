[Creature Comforts](https://creaturecomfortsbeer.com/), a Athens-based brewery, called for design submissions for a [Free Little Library](https://littlefreelibrary.org/). Instead of using the optional design template, I created a miniature model of the iconic [Snow Tire building](https://beerconnoisseur.com/sites/default/files/u12700/side.jpg) with a working garage door while [Dominique Roth](https://niqueroth.com/) provided the lively art work. Our submission finished in the top 3 of designs.
