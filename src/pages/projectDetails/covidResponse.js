                  In March 2020, COVID-19 shut down the University of Georgia (and the rest of the
                  country) for the foreseeable future. All students and non-essential employees were
                  sent home, and my fabrication team initially assumed we'd be going away as well.
                  However, after Piedmont Athens Regional Medical Center desperately reached out for
                  additional PPE supplies, we rushed to design and manufacture economical,
                  comfortable, and practical face shields.

                <p>
                  To begin, we defined our requirements. Due to a country-wide supply shortage, the
                  face shield material had to be easily accessible, cheap, cleanable, and
                  antimicrobial. The material also had to be compatible with our existing machinery.
                  Stakeholders said they would be wearing the face shields for extended periods, so
                  the design needed to be lightweight &#38; breathable. Finally, the shield had to
                  cover as much of the face as possible without restricting movement to protect the
                  user.

                <h2 className="numbered-heading1">Initial Design</h2>
                <p>
                  We researched existing face shield plans, and our first prototype was a modified
                  file from the open-source CAD website{' '}
                  <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/">Thingiverse</a>. The shield was 2 mm clear
                  acrylic that was easy to laser cut without dangerous fumes, and the straps were
                  hand-cut velcro. While the design was 3D printable and lightweight, our
                  stakeholders said it was extremely uncomfortable due to the thin headband and
                  velcro straps. Also, FDM 3D prints are rough and anisotropic, making the bands
                  hard to sanitize and easily breakable. Lastly, the shield material was too rigid
                  and obstructed the user from moving their head around.

                <p>
                  Building on stakeholder feedback, I created a new headband in Inventor that was
                  thick enough to be virtually unbreakable. It could also fit a replaceable foam pad
                  for comfort and cleanability, making 3D printing a viable option again. For
                  scalability, the headband design could be stacked 12 high with a small amount of
                  support in-between, and 2 stacks could be nested onto one 3D print bed. We could
                  print 24 headbands every 12 hours on just one printer on the fastest setting. We
                  used ABS material for maximum rigidity, cleanliness, and widely available.

                <p>
                  The straps and shields were redesigned to be nestable and laser cut to avoid a
                  bottleneck. Instead of using velcro, the headband had multiple hooks on either
                  side that a flexible rubber strap could fasten onto. After I manually adjusted the
                  laser cutter for the thickness of the rubber, we could cut 80 straps from one
                  rubber sheet in under 30 minutes. Instead of using 2 mm acrylic sheets, we used
                  cheaper 1 mm sheets for increased flexibility. I modified the shield to have
                  45-degree cuts on either side, so users could move their heads side-to-side.
